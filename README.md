# Place Keeper

Map Sharing Application with Just a Link.

## Overview

Place Keeper is a web application that allows owners to create maps with pinned locations and share them via a unique URL.  
No app installation or login is required for viewersâ€”anyone with the link can access the shared map instantly.

### For Owners

-   **Secure Authentication:** Sign up and log in with email verification.
-   **Pin & Save Locations:** Click on the map to place a pin, assign a location name, add a description, and save it.
-   **Flexible Map Navigation:** Move the map by dragging or searching for an address before placing a pin.
-   **Easy Sharing:** Generate a unique sharing code to allow others to view your saved locations.

### For Shared Users

-   **No Login Required:** Just open the URL provided by the Owner to view the pinned locations.
-   **Read-Only Mode:** Shared users can view locations but cannot add, edit, or delete them.

### Common Features

-   **Pin List & Quick Jump:** Clicking a location in the list moves the map to the corresponding pin.
-   **Search Functionality:** Quickly find saved locations using a search bar.
-   **Route Display:** If multiple locations are saved, select them via checkboxes to display a route between them.

## Attention

Running the application locally requires a description of the mail server in the .env file, which is not included here for security reasons.

Also, the database may go to sleep and not work well.

Therefore, if you are considering running the application or have any problems, please contact me at the email address listed on my GitHub. (It may take a few days to contact you. Please understand.)
